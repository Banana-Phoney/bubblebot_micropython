bubblebot with Micropython on the ESP8266

Same as with the raspberry pi made over [here](https://github.com/BananaJohnny/bubbles) just finaly got some ESP8266 boards.


parts list:

1 x ESP8266 NodeMCU.

1 X MG90S Servo - generic.

1 x 3V to 6V motor - generic.

1 x 5V Relay board - used to keep the motor on its own circuit.

1 x 5V 2.1A powerbank - This powers the Pi, Servo and Relay.

2 x 3.6V 2200 mAh 18650 li ion battery - This is added to drive the motor. I got problems trying to drive everything including the motor from one batteri pack.
